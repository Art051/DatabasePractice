First attempt at interacting with a MySQL database setup locally.
University database with one table holding student info. Basic program to send queries to the database and also create students with random names and generated passwords. Emails setup using names and then courses selected at random from a pre-defined list.
Practice was aimed at seeing the interaction between a project in Java and a MySQL database, improvements could be made by taking actual user input for student credentials via a GUI window. Setting up multiple tables for various user types such as lecturers/staff could also be done, with queries being sent to different tables to carry out comparisons of data between tables.
